## Description 
This application showcases my refactoring of the code for a landing page for a digital marketing agency: Horiseon. 
<br></br>
The goal was to optimize the HTML page for seo by:
* Organizing the text and making it easier to read
* Using HTML semantic elements to specify how the search engine should treat the sections in the HTML code (will reference a main body of text in the search result, not text contained in the header or footer)
* Going through and eliminating any redundancies in the CSS code
* Ensuring we could accomplish the same desired results with as little CSS code as possible. 

<br></br>
This code refactor represents an important stepping stone in further building my knowledge of HTML and CSS and to inspired me to find creative ways to create clean, minimalistic code. 

## Installation
No installation required, access the application at the deployed URL: https://garretthilberling.github.io/css-code-refactor

## Usage
The layout is a simple informative landing page. Clicking any of the buttons in the navigation bar at the top of the page will result in a jump to the corresponding section of the page.
