# Digital Marketing Made Easy with Horiseon

## Description 
For this project we were tasked with refactoring the code of a landing page for digital marketing agency, Horiseon. The goal was to optimize the HTML page for seo by organizing the text and making it easier to read, using HTML semantic elements to specify how the search engine should treat the sections in the HTML code (will reference a main body of text in the search result, not text contained in the header or footer), went through and eliminated any redundancies in the CSS code, and ensured we could accomplish the same desired results with as little CSS code as possible. The purpose of this assignment was to put our current knowledge of HTML and CSS to the test and to encourage us to find creative ways to create clean, minimalistic code. 

## Installation
No installation required, access the application at the live URL via this link: https://garretthilberling.github.io/hilberling-challenge-1/

## Usage
The layout is a simple informative landing page. The focus of the assignment is on visual aesthetics and the neatness of the code itself. However, clicking any of the buttons in the navigation bar at the top of the page will result in a jump to the corresponding section.
